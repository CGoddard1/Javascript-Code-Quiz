# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## Usage

This project contains a 5 question quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Click the start button and a 75sec timer will begin, each question takes roughly 15 seconds of time to answer and the score is scored via how quickly the user answers the questions. If a question is wrong, there is a 5 second penalty.
